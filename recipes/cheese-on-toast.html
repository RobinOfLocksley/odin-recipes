            <img src="../img/cheese-on-toast.gif" alt="very literal cheese on toast">
            <p>Do you ever feel hungry and think to yourself "I could really do with eating just Carb and Fat".</p>
            <p>Well, You're in luck. Cheese on Toast is the perfect balance of needing food but not wanting nutrition.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Follow along to learn and finally call your Mum to say "Yes Mum, I can cook for myself". Then you'll get the respect you deserve.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Now believe me when I say, if you can read the title then you shouldn't need this.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheese</li>
                    <li>Toast</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aaaah, I got you. You will need bread technically</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Now you have these ready, we'll begin</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Here we go:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Put your bread in the toaster on the lowest setting</li>
                    <ul>You don't want to toast it too much, just dry slightly crisp it</ul>
                <li>While the toast is going, turn your grill on low-medium and start slicing/grating cheese.</li>
                <li>by the time you finish the cheese your toaster should have popped. This is when you put the cheese on the toast</li>
                <li>Now the finale, place the cheese on toast into the grill and keep an eye on it until you see the cheese fully melted</li>
                <li>Finally, take it out and call your parents. You've earned it</li>
            </ol>

            <p>And that is it. Congratulations and good luck going into adulthood.</p>
